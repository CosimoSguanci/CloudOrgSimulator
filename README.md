## Installation instructions
The best way to build and run the CloudSimPlus simulation is by using IntelliJ IDEA. 
The steps to be followed are the following:
- Install the Java SE Development Kit (available [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk13-archive-downloads.html))
- Install Scala through sbt (installation files available [here](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/scala3.html))
- Install IntelliJ IDEA ([link](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download))
- Install The Scala plugin for IntelliJ ([link] https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1347-scala))
- The setup is now complete, you may clone the repository, open the project in IntelliJ that will start the first build

Notice that every simulation has a Scala file that contains a @main method and therefore can be used to run the simulation (e.g., `SaasWorkspaceSimulationBasic` can be run by using `RunSaasWorkspaceSimulationBasic`).

Details about the implemented models and simulations can be found in the `doc/DOC.md` file.
