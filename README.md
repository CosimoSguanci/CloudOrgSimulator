# Overview
## Implemented cloud models
- A SaaS infrastructure inspired by Google Workspace. It was modeled from the point of view of the service provider that is offering some type of cloud services (in particular email, cloud docs and cloud storage) to an organization (such as another company that uses it as a business tool)
- An IaaS/PaaS/FaaS infrastructure that resembles a subset of Amazon Web Services .

Once these two models have been built, they have been simulated under several conditions: different workloads, different policies for allocation of resource and scaling strategies.
